    <string name="instructions2">Songle is a location-based mobile phone puzzle game. Users follow a map and collect words which have been scattered at random around the University of Edinburghâ€™s Central Area. To collect a word click on the marker when you think you are sufficiently close. The words make up the lyrics of a well-known song and the puzzle aspect of the game is to guess the song from the words which have been found. You may ask for a hint. The map key is provided below. The more interesting a word the longer it is, potentially making it more useful.</string>
